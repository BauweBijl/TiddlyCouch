## TiddlyCouch

TiddlyCouch lets you serve a TiddlyWiki from CouchDB and read and write individual tiddlers to the database. Each tiddler is saved as a separate document.
It consists of a couchapp and some TiddlyWiki plugins.

Option 2: install [couchapp](http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp), checkout this repository and run ./deploy URL-for-your-database

## Notes

This is the product of a quick hacking session with [FND](http://fnd.lewcid.org) and is meant as a demo rather than a finished product.
